# ReadMe Generator

## Description

- My motivation for this project is to create an interactive application which allows the user to enter data and be formatted into a readme file
- I built this project because it will help me generate future Readme acting as a future template
- This application saves time in researching the components of a Readme and allows me to answer simple questions and makes a clean simple readme with less effort 
- I learned how to write to a file and use inquirer packages to write and output code

## Installation

To install and run this application, you have to first install the inquirer package in the JSON foler and also run node index.js to get the application to run and generate a README.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
