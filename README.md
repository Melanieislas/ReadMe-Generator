# ReadMe Generator

## Description

- My motivation for this project is to create an interactive application which allows the user to enter data and be formatted into a readme file
- I built this project because it will help me generate future Readme acting as a future template
- This application saves time in researching the components of a Readme and allows me to answer simple questions and makes a clean simple readme with less effort 
- I learned how to write to a file and use inquirer packages to write and output code

## Installation

To install and run this application, you have to first install the inquirer package in the JSON foler and also run node index.js to get the application to run and generate a README.

## Usage

The following screenshots are examples of a README file generated using the inquirer package and user input from the terminal.

This is the link to the functional application.
